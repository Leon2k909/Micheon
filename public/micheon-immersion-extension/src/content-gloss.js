/**
 * Runs on every page. Two things, both entirely offline against Micheon's
 * own bundled word list (data/words.json) -- no translation API, no network
 * call beyond loading that one local file:
 *
 *   1. Glossing: a word already in the list gets a dotted underline and a
 *      hover/focus tooltip with its translation. German page -> English
 *      gloss (reinforcement of what you're learning). Non-German page ->
 *      German gloss on English words that have a taught equivalent (recall
 *      prompt, so pages you'd otherwise read in English still teach).
 *   2. Missing-vocabulary collection: on German text, a real-looking German
 *      word that ISN'T in the list gets counted with the sentence it
 *      appeared in. This is a candidate list for a human (or a future
 *      authoring pass) to review -- never auto-added, same as every other
 *      pack in Micheon.
 *
 * YouTube and X are special cases. Their page chrome renders in the ACCOUNT's
 * interface language, so page-level language detection reads a German-locale
 * YouTube as "German page" even under an English video -- that poisoned the
 * candidate list once already. But video titles and descriptions on
 * German-learning channels are exactly the vocabulary worth reading. So on
 * YouTube this script scans ONLY the watch page's title + description
 * containers, and decides German-or-not per container from that container's
 * own text, never from the page around it. X is similarly limited to actual
 * tweet bodies: account names, trends, timestamps and translated interface
 * controls are not language-learning evidence.

  /**
   * The strong verbs, written as principal parts.
   *
   * A strong verb changes its stem vowel, and no suffix rule can undo that:
   * gefunden does not contain finden, gibt does not contain geben, gegangen
   * does not contain gehen. The map above had picked these up one at a time as
   * somebody noticed them, and the newest export shows what that leaves: of the
   * fifty-one commonest strong forms, thirty-six resolved to nothing, and every
   * one of their infinitives was already in the glossary. These are not rare
   * words -- they are sein, geben, gehen, nehmen, finden, sprechen -- so the
   * reader was getting silence on the most ordinary verbs on the page while

   *

   * spans the word and the tip together, or the tip goes. No events from
   * the page are trusted, no timers are involved, and a destroyed element
   * changes nothing because the anchor is a cached rectangle.

   * ── zero-mutation glossing (CSS Custom Highlight API) ─────────────────
   *
   * The extension used to wrap each matched word in a <span>. That REWRITES
   * the page's DOM, and on React/Polymer apps the framework still believes
   * it owns those nodes: the next re-render of anything we touched throws
   * (React's removeChild on a node we replaced) and takes the feature with
   * it. That killed X's translate toggle three separate ways -- the button
   * label, the status label next to it, and the tweet body itself -- and
   * skip-lists can never enumerate every element a framework might redraw.
   *
   * The Highlight API styles TEXT RANGES with no DOM change at all, so
   * there is nothing for a framework to trip over. The price: no elements
   * to hover, so the tooltip is driven by caret hit-testing on mousemove,
   * and keyboard focus on individual glosses is gone. When a page's text
   * node is replaced by the app, the range collapses harmlessly and the
   * mutation observer re-walks the new node.
