/**
 * Saving progress never blocks the process that owns the windows.
 *
 * The desktop app runs the Express server inside Electron's main process, and
 * the store is the whole shared progress file — hundreds of kilobytes,
 * rewritten on every grade. A synchronous write there stalls the process
 * every window lives on, at exactly the moments the learner is doing
 * something; with an overlay on screen those stalls read as the app "causing
 * lag". So the save path must answer from memory, write asynchronously, and
 * replace the file atomically so a crash mid-write cannot tear the only copy
 * of someone's progress.
 *
 * Checked behaviourally against a real server on a scratch APPDATA, then
 * pinned in source, because the behaviour half alone cannot see atomicity —
 * a torn write only shows up as a corrupted file on the one day it matters.
